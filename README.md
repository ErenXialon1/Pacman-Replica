### I tried to make original pac-man from scratch without copying tutorials.
### Assets of game not the same but the similar of original.
## In this project I tried some systems first time, here they are:
### UI
### Basic Enemy AIs
### Physics2D 
### Basic Scriptable Objects
### Animator
### Basic Scene Management Methods
